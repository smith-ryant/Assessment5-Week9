A "column undefined" error typically occurs when you're trying to interact with a column in a database that doesn't exist. This could happen for a few reasons:

Typo in Column Name: You might have made a typo in the column name in your SQL query. Column names are case-sensitive in some databases, so ensure that the case matches exactly.

Column Doesn't Exist: The column you're trying to interact with might not exist in the table. Check your database schema to ensure that the column exists.

Table Doesn't Exist: The table you're trying to interact with might not exist. If the table doesn't exist, then none of its columns will exist either.

In your createCity function, you're interacting with the name, rating, and country_id columns in the cities table. If you're getting a "column undefined" error in this function, it's likely that one of these columns doesn't exist in the cities table. Check your database schema to ensure that these columns exist.



let { name, rating, country_name } = req.body;: This line is using destructuring assignment to extract name, rating, and country_name properties from req.body. req.body typically contains the data sent by the client in the body of the HTTP request.

sequelize.query(SELECT country_id FROM countries WHERE name = '${country_name}'): This line is executing a SQL query to select the country_id from the countries table where the name matches the country_name provided in the request body. This is done to get the country_id associated with the provided country_name.

.then((dbRes) => {...}): This is a Promise that gets resolved when the above SQL query is completed. The result of the query (i.e., the country_id) is passed to the callback function as dbRes.

if (!dbRes[0][0]) {...}: This line checks if the query returned a result. If the country_name does not exist in the countries table, dbRes[0][0] will be undefined, and the function will send a 400 status code with an error message "Country not found".

let country_id = dbRes[0][0].country_id;: If the country was found, this line extracts the country_id from the first record of the query result.

return sequelize.query(...) : This line executes another SQL query to insert a new record into the cities table using the name, rating, and country_id obtained earlier.

The second .then((dbRes) => {...}) is another Promise that gets resolved when the INSERT query is completed. If the insertion is successful, it sends a 200 status code along with the result of the query.

.catch((err) => {...}): This is a catch block that handles any errors that might occur during the execution of the SQL queries. If an error occurs, it logs the error and sends a 500 status code with an error message "An error occurred while creating the city".
